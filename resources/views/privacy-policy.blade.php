                <li><strong>How, Where and For How Long Do We Store Your Data?</strong>
                    <ol class="list-ordered">
                        <li>Some of the external third parties to whom we transfer your personal data are based outside the UK and European Economic Area <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">(&ldquo;<strong>EEA</strong>&rdquo;)</span>, such as Amazon Web Services Inc., so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK/EEA<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span> (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.) These are known as &ldquo;third countries&rdquo; and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. This means that we will take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and will be fully protected under the UK GDPR, EU GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018 and/or to equivalent standards by law. Transfers of personal data to the EEA from the UK are permitted without additional safeguards. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <ol class="list-ordered">
                                    <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><em>European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</em></span></a><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><em>;</em></span></li>
                                    <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use standard contractual clauses (&lsquo;SCCs&rsquo;), approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><em>European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</em></span></a><span style="color: #3f3f3f;"><em>;</em></span></li>
                                    <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we will make an assessment to determine whether we can transfer your personal data on the basis of SCCs taking into account the circumstances of the transfer, and put supplementary measures in place if required. The supplementary measures along with SCCs follow a case-by-case analysis of the circumstances surrounding the transfer and this would ensure that U.S. law does not encroach on the satisfactory level of protection guarantee. If we come to the decision, taking into account the circumstances of the transfer and possible supplementary measures, that appropriate safeguards would not be ensured, then we will either suspend the transfer of your personal data until we ensure an adequate level of protection can be provided or we might end the transfer of your personal data.</li>

                    <li>Data security is very important to us, and to protect your data we have put in place suitable security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. By way of example, these include encryption and the use of passwords. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</li>
                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.</span></li>
                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</span></li>
                    <li>We will generally retain your personal data for the duration of your membership (if applicable) or otherwise for [2years]. Notwithstanding this, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</li>

                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <ol class="list-ordered">
                                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Request access&nbsp;</strong>to your personal data (commonly known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</span></li>
                                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Request correction&nbsp;</strong>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</span></li>
                                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Request erasure&nbsp;</strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</span></li>
                                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Object to processing&nbsp;</strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</span></li>
                                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Request restriction of processing&nbsp;</strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</span>

We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span></li>
                                    <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Withdraw consent at any time&nbsp;</strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</span></li>
                                    <li><strong>Rights with respect to automated decision making and profiling</strong>. We may use personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making where those decisions have a legal (or similarly significant effect) on you. We may do this by way of using a third party API to approve our subscriber member insurance documents and business for listing on our website. If at any point you wish to query any action that we<strong>&nbsp;</strong>take on the basis of this or wish to request &lsquo;human intervention&rsquo; (i.e. have someone review the action themselves, rather than relying only on the automated method), data protection laws give you the right to do so. Where we use your personal data for profiling purposes, the following shall apply:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                            <ol class="list-ordered">

                        <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.&nbsp;</span></li>
                        <li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="color: #191919; background-color: #ffffff;">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. In the case of subject access requests,&nbsp;</span>normally, we<strong>&nbsp;</strong>aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within one month. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress.</li>
                        <li>If you require any information about our<strong>&nbsp;</strong>use of your personal data or exercising your rights as outlined above, please contact us using the details provided in section 9. Further information about your rights can also be obtained from the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office or your local Citizens Advice Bureau. If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, please contact us using the details provided in section 9 and we will do our best to solve the problem for you. If we are unable to help, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK&rsquo;s supervisory authority, the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office <span style="color: #191919; background-color: #ffffff;">(<a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/"><span style="color: rgb(11, 93, 151);"><em>www.ico.org.uk</em></span></a>)</span>.
