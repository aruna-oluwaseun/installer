Details of our packages and the corresponding Listing Fees (and the resources and Services available for each level of subscription) are available on Our Site here: <a href="https://fedca.co.uk/packages"><span style="color: rgb(11, 76, 180);">https://fedca.co.uk/packages</span></a> (each a &ldquo;<strong>Package</strong>&rdquo;).</li>

                        <li>Should you wish to cancel your subscription, please notify us in writing, via email at [info@fedca.co.uk] [] before your Paid Listing is due to renew. If we do not receive a termination notification from you, your Paid Listing will be automatically renewed for a further year and the Listing Fee due upfront or in monthly instalments.&nbsp;If you cancel your membership subscription for convenience, you will still be required to make monthly payments for the remainder of the one-year period (if you pay on a monthly basis). If you pay annually in advance, you will not be entitled to a refund if you terminate your subscription early.</li>
                        <li>All payments on Our Site are made and processed through our third party payment service provider, Stripe.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span>Your payment will be charged when We process your order and send you a Listing Confirmation and on the day before each renewal date. You shall provide valid, up-to-date and complete credit card details or approved purchase order information and any other relevant valid, up-to-date and complete contact and billing details and, if you provide your credit card details, you authorise Stripe to bill such credit card in accordance with your subscription plan.</li>
                        <li>We shall be entitled to increase the Listing Fees from time to time on [14days] prior notice and the<em>&nbsp;</em>Listing Confirmation shall be deemed to have been amended accordingly. If such increase takes place before the renewal of your current subscription, you shall be entitled to terminate the Contract by giving us [14days] notice and receive a pro-rated refund.</li>
                        <li>Payments due must be made in UK pounds sterling in full, without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding (except where any deduction or withholding of tax is required by law).</li>

Such interest will accrue daily from the date the amount became due until it is paid in full, accruing after as well as before judgment. If you do not make payment within [7 days] of Our reminder, We may cancel the Contract, and will inform you of the cancellation in writing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We may also end the Contract if you are a business or company and you go into liquidation or administration, have a receiver appointed or suffer any analogous action in consequence of a debt, or if you are made bankrupt (if you are an individual), or if you cease to carry on the business or trade for which you are listed on Our Site (or threaten to do so), or if you are in material breach of these Terms of Sale, or if you damage our goodwill or do anything that is likely to bring our company&rsquo;s reputation into disrepute.</li>
